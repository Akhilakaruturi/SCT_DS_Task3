Decision Tree Classifier (Bank Marketing Dataset)

 📊 Dataset:
Bank Marketing Dataset (Kaggle)

Objective:
The objective of this project is to build a Decision Tree Classifier to predict whether a customer will subscribe to a term deposit (`deposit = yes/no`) based on demographic and behavioral data.

🧾 Project Description:
This project involves loading and exploring the Bank Marketing dataset, preprocessing numerical and categorical features, and training a Decision Tree Classifier using a machine learning pipeline. The model performance is evaluated using standard classification metrics, and the trained decision tree is visualized to understand decision-making rules.


## ⚙️ Steps Performed
1. Loaded the Bank Marketing dataset with the correct delimiter.
2. Performed data inspection and verified there were no missing values.
3. Separated features and target variable (`deposit`).
4. Applied feature engineering using scaling and one-hot encoding.
5. Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
6. Trained a Decision Tree Classifier using a pipeline.
7. Evaluated the model using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.
8. Visualized the decision tree.


Technologies Used:
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Google Colab

 📈 Results:
The Decision Tree Classifier successfully predicts customer subscription behavior.  
The model demonstrates that customer interaction duration, campaign details, and previous outcomes significantly influence subscription decisions.
